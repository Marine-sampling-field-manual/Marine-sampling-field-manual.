The NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub has developed a suite of field manuals to describe a nationally consistent and defensible approach to marine data acquisition. With over 70 contributors from 30 agencies, the field manuals include information on marine survey design, pre-survey planning, gear deployment and retrieval, and data management.

For more information about the field manuals and their benefits, see this news story: [Marine sampling field manuals support biodiversity monitoring at a national scale](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/news/marine-sampling-field-manuals-support-biodiversity-monitoring-national-scale).
